#### MSA MEGA File Parser #####
This tool is mainly to parse through an MSA file (in the MEGA format) and give out a UI representation of the analysis of the mutations occurred.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Still in the development phases. Would be putting out a link to the binaries once the complete development and testing is done.

### Functionalities ###

Majorly 2 widgets:

* First (main) widget asks user to select MEGA file from desktop. It shows minimal information of how many mutations and the score.
  * * The main window lets you select the MEGA file from your file browser
